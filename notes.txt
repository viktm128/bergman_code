Using Lukes sub kernel coefficients, it seemes like it will be easier to prove that they are increasing
each subkernel has exactly 4 terms except the last one which is just m^2

The first two of the four have variously increasing powers, but there is only 2-3 terms of each power in the 
list of subkernels

Worth proving this fact, and then we only need to prove finite inequalities
