# Research Overview

I have been informally with Luke Edholm since my undergraduate at Michigan on some researh on several complex
variables. This repo is highly undocumented as the research is on going. The PDF file left in the note gives a 
general overview about the state of the research and which problems are still open.

The purpose of this research was to teach myself some basic julia and use its computational power to generate 
examples and counterexamples as needed. This work is traditionally done in Sage or Mathematica, but both have 
incredibly expensive licensing fees if you aren't tied to a university.
